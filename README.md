# Overview of neural network charity analysis

### The purpose of this analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning and neural networks and the features in the dataset in order to create a binary classifer that can predict whether applicants will be successful if they are funded by the non-profit foundation, Alphabet Soup that is dedicated to helping organizations that protect general well-being and unify the world. They have been raising and donating money for the past 20 years.  This analysis contains data from over 34,000 organizations and will hopefully be able to predict the success of applicants funded by Alphabet Soup.
